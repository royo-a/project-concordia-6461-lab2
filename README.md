# project-concordia-6461-lab2
In this project, I created a command line file server application (using the 'net' library of Node.js) which serves HTTP POST and GET requests.

The features of the application are:
1. Serves files from a specified directory
2. Prevents accessing file in outside directories
3. Generates error messages
4. Allows changing the port and default directory with a command-line interface
5. Serves files in the format mentioned in 'Accept' key
